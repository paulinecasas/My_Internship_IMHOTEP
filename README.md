# My_Internship_IMHOTEP
Here are the notebooks I produced during my internship at IGE in connection with the IMHOTEP research project. I was interested in the impact of runoff variation on ocean surface salinity. 

=========================================== IMHOTEP 

The main goal of IMHOTEP is to understand the response of the global ocean to continental freshwater dis-
charges in order to investigate the evolution of sea level, a direct consequence of global warming. To do so,
IMHOTEP isolates and quantifies the response of sea level components at a regional scale, and of salinity, ocean cir-
culation or water mass properties, to freshwater discharges of north/tropical Atlantic and Indian oceans. Sensitivity
runs are produced based on global ocean simulations, where various sources of freshwater (rivers and Greenland
ice melt) are either set to fully variable (interannual) or climatological, and allow to reveal the impacts of these
freshwater sources on the global ocean.

For my internship, I am interested in the salinity response to runoffs fluctuations. I will use the outcomes of
the aforementioned sensitivity runs, to quantify and analyze the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) response to freshwater
discharges with a focus on the North Atlantic basin.
